A high-performance directory deletion tool written in Rust, specifically optimized for large directories like `node_modules` that contain thousands of small files and deeply nested folder structures.

## Features

- **‚ö° Lightning Fast**: Optimized for deleting directories with thousands of small files
- **üîÑ Concurrent Operations**: Uses async/await for maximum performance
- **üìè Long Path Support**: Handles Windows long path names (>260 characters)
- **üìä Progress Tracking**: Visual feedback and detailed statistics
- **üõ°Ô∏è Safe & Reliable**: Confirmation prompts and graceful error handling
- **üíæ Memory Efficient**: Recursive traversal without excessive memory usage
- **üéØ Self-Documenting**: Clean, maintainable code that explains what it's doing

## Why FastDel?

Traditional deletion tools can be extremely slow when dealing with directories like `node_modules` that contain:
- Thousands of small files
- Deeply nested directory structures surpassing path limits of 260
- Very long file paths (especially on Windows)

FastDel is specifically designed to handle these scenarios efficiently by:
- Using asynchronous I/O operations
- Processing files and directories concurrently
- Minimizing system call overhead
- Handling Windows long path limitations

## Quick Demo with Docker

The easiest way to try FastDel is using our Docker demo:

### Prerequisites
- Docker installed and running
- Docker Compose (included with Docker Desktop)

### Run the Demo

**Windows:**
```cmd
.\run-demo.bat
```

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
chmod +x run-demo.sh
./run-demo.sh
```

### Demo Options

```bash
# Basic demo (default)
./run-demo.sh basic

# Performance test with large directory structure
./run-demo.sh performance

# Interactive session to try commands manually
./run-demo.sh interactive

# Build Docker image only
./run-demo.sh build

# Clean up Docker resources
./run-demo.sh clean
```

The demo creates realistic directory structures similar to `node_modules` and demonstrates FastDel's performance advantages.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.70 or later
- Windows, macOS, or Linux

### Build from Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FunToHard/fastdel.git
cd fastdel
cargo build --release
```

The compiled binary will be available at `target/release/fastdel.exe` (Windows) or `target/release/fastdel` (Unix).

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Delete a directory with confirmation
fastdel ./node_modules

# Skip confirmation prompt
fastdel -y ./node_modules

# Verbose output with progress tracking
fastdel -v ./large_directory

# Combine flags
fastdel -yv ./path/to/delete
```

### Command Line Options

```
fastdel [OPTIONS] <PATH>

Arguments:
  <PATH>  Directory path to delete (e.g., ./node_modules)

Options:
  -y, --yes      Skip confirmation prompt and delete immediately
  -v, --verbose  Enable verbose output with detailed progress
  -h, --help     Print help
  -V, --version  Print version
```

### Using FastDel with Docker

You can also use FastDel via Docker to delete real directories:

```bash
# Build the FastDel image
docker build -t fastdel .

# Delete a directory on your host system
docker run --rm -v "/path/to/delete:/target" fastdel fastdel -yv /target

# Interactive mode for exploring
docker run --rm -it -v "/path/to/workspace:/workspace" fastdel bash
```

**Windows example:**
```cmd
docker run --rm -v "C:\path\to\delete:/target" fastdel fastdel -yv /target
```

### Examples

```bash
# Delete node_modules with confirmation
fastdel ./node_modules

# Batch delete multiple directories
fastdel -y ./project1/node_modules
fastdel -y ./project2/node_modules  
fastdel -y ./project3/node_modules

# Delete with verbose progress tracking
fastdel -v ./large_build_output

# Force delete without confirmation (use with caution!)
fastdel -y ./temp_directory
```

## Output

FastDel provides clear, colorized output:

### Confirmation Prompt
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING
You are about to permanently delete:
  C:\dev\nextjstest\node_modules

Are you sure you want to continue? (y/N):
```

### Progress Output (Verbose Mode)
```
üöÄ Starting fast deletion...
Target: C:\dev\myproject\node_modules

Deleted file: C:\dev\myproject\node_modules\package\file.js
Deleted directory: C:\dev\myproject\node_modules\package
...
```

### Completion Summary
```
‚úÖ Deletion completed successfully!

üìä Summary:
  Files deleted: 45,239
  Directories deleted: 8,412
  Space freed: 892.47 MB
  Time taken: 2.35s
  Performance: 19,251 files/sec
```

## Performance

FastDel is optimized for performance:

- **Concurrent Operations**: Files within each directory are processed concurrently
- **Async I/O**: Non-blocking file system operations
- **Minimal Overhead**: Direct system calls without unnecessary abstractions
- **Smart Traversal**: Depth-first traversal optimized for deletion order

### Benchmark Results

Typical performance on a directory with ~50,000 files:
- **Traditional `rm -rf`**: 15-30 seconds
- **FastDel**: 2-5 seconds
- **Improvement**: 3-6x faster

*Performance varies based on file system, disk type, and directory structure.*

## Safety Features

- **Confirmation Prompt**: Requires explicit confirmation before deletion
- **Path Validation**: Ensures target exists and is a directory
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of permission errors and locked files
- **Non-destructive by Default**: Will not delete without confirmation

## Technical Details

### Architecture

- **Language**: Rust (for memory safety and performance)
- **Async Runtime**: Tokio for concurrent operations
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting with context
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

### Long Path Support

FastDel handles Windows long path names (>260 characters) by:
- Using absolute path resolution
- Proper Unicode handling
- Working with Windows extended path prefixes

### Concurrency Model

- Processes files within each directory concurrently
- Uses depth-first recursive traversal for directories
- Limits concurrent operations to prevent resource exhaustion
- Thread-safe statistics tracking

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Permission Denied Errors**
```bash
# Run with elevated privileges (Windows)
# Right-click Command Prompt -> "Run as Administrator"
fastdel ./locked_directory
```

**Path Too Long (Windows)**
- FastDel automatically handles long paths
- Ensure you're using the absolute path

**Directory Not Empty Errors**
- FastDel handles this automatically by deleting contents first
- Check for hidden files or running processes

### Debug Mode

For debugging issues, use verbose mode:
```bash
fastdel -v ./problematic_directory
```

This will show detailed progress and any errors encountered.
